# Longtail_Finder_GoogleAutocompleteAPI

A program that uses the Google autocomplete API in order to find longtail for ecommerce or for product research.

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter a search term.
Enter one search term that would like to find long tails for and press enter/return.
The program will query the Google Autocomplete API to compile a huge list of longtails.
The program will save those search terms to an excel file.
Row 1 of the excel file is the search term that the program used to produce the results.
The subsequent results are the results of the autocomplete data.

Enjoy~
